## JavaScript Basic Practice Algorithms

> The purpose is to build your JavaScript skills to start making simple programs with each algorithm increasing in complexity and using more JavaScript concepts.

## How to get Started

1. Install Node JS (Opt for the LTS version).
2. Open up the integrated terminal within VS Code
3. To run the file ensure you are in the correct folder within the terminal
and then run:
    `node <name-of-file>` 
    e.g `node 01 - even-or-odd.js`
4. You should then see if your solution passed the tests within the console.
5. Only move onto the next algorithm once all tests have passed.# practice-github-commands
